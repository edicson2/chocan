# Chocoholics Anonymous

Chocoholics Anonymous (ChocAn) is an organization dedicated to helping people addicted to chocolate in all its glorious forms. Members pay a monthly fee to ChocAn. For this fee they are entitled to unlimited consultations and treatments with health care professionals, namely, dietitians, internists, and exercise specialists. Every member is given a plastic card embossed with the member’s name and a nine-digit member number and incorporating a magnetic strip on which that information is encoded. Each health care professional (provider) who provides services to ChocAn members has a specially designed ChocAn computer terminal, similar to a credit card machine in a shop. When a provider’s terminal is switched on, the provider is asked to enter his or her provider number.
